!> **Warning**: This method of notifying AppSignal of deploys has been [removed in AppSignal Ruby gem version 3.0](/ruby/installation/upgrade-from-2-to-3.html#removed-appsignal-notify_of_deploy-command). Please use the `revision` config option instead. Read our [deploy marker](/application/markers/deploy-markers.html) section for more information on how to create deploy markers.

Command line tool to send a "Deploy Marker" for an application to AppSignal.

Deploy markers are used on AppSignal.com to indicate changes in an application, "Deploy markers" indicate a deploy of an application.

Incidents for exceptions and performance issues will be closed and reopened if they occur again in the new deploy.

Note: The same logic is used in the Capistrano integration. A deploy marker is created on each deploy.

This tool was available between versions 0.2.5 and 2.11.10 of the AppSignal Ruby gem.

Please read our documentation on [Deploy markers] for recommended alternative methods of sending deploy markers to AppSignal.
